# Powerpoint-Speaker-Notes

## Goal

PowerPoint has a great digital speaker's view, but it's not printable. This project aims to add a speaker-note-slide after each slide, with speaker notes and a screenshot of the original slide. The goal is to allow presenters to use flip cards to present these slides.

## Description

This tool automatically generates a new slide after each original slide in a PowerPoint presentation. The new slide contains:
- The speaker notes for the preceding slide
- A screenshot/image of the original slide

This makes it easy to print or use physical flip cards for presentations, giving presenters a portable, paper-based speaker view.
